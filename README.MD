Singapore Changi Airport (WSSS) for FS2020, Version 0.9 (2022-12-22). 

By Zenith Creations (Zachary Tay). 

This add-on is the culmination of two years' worth of work on various aspects of the airport. 
It updates Changi Airport (WSSS) taxiways and gates to be Phase 4 compliant. 
That means that they are accurate as of 2022-12-21. 
This is not complete, with some issues. 
Nevertheless, it means the airport is VATSIM/IVAO ready and compliant with the latest charts and AIRAC.
 
The issues remaining are largely cosmetic, like Jewel missing and PAPI lights misplaced. We would dearly love to fix the PAPIs, but ADE doesn't offer any way to move/add them as of yet, so unfortunately that will stay an issue for now.

CHANGELOG V0.9:
- Gate and stand numbers (3XX, 4XX, 5XX) updated with reference to the AIP from CAAS
- Taxiway signs updated
- More tee marks added for main gates (for smaller jets)

Install by moving the contents of the Community folder into your FS2020 Community folder.

We hope you'll enjoy this improvement over the default WSSS, now further updated, and Merry Christmas.
