Singapore Changi Airport (WSSS) for FS2020. 

By Zenith Creations (Zachary Tay). 

This add-on is the culmination of over a yearâ€™s worth of work on various aspects of the airport. 
It add-on updates Changi Airport (WSSS) taxiways to be Phase 4 compliant. 
That means that they are accurate as of 2021-12-24. 
This is not complete, with some issues. 
Nevertheless, it means the airport is VATSIM/IVAO ready and compliant with the latest charts and AIRAC. 
The issues outstanding are the gates, some are not numbered correctly. 02R/20L taxiway signs are also incomplete.

Install by moving the contents of the Community folder into your FS2020 Community folder.

I hope you'll enjoy this improvement over the default WSSS, and Merry Christmas.
